netty-http
==========
A library to develop HTTP services with `Netty <http://netty.io/>`__. Supports the capability to route end-points based on `JAX-RS <https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/>`__-style annotations. Implements Guava's Service interface to manage the runtime-state of the HTTP service.

Need for this library
---------------------
`Netty <http://netty.io/>`__ is a powerful framework to write asynchronous event-driven high-performance applications. While it is relatively easy to write a RESTful HTTP service using netty, the mapping between HTTP routes to handlers is
not a straight-forward task.

Mapping the routes to method handlers requires writing custom channel handlers and a lot of boilerplate code
as well as knowledge of Netty's internals in order to correctly chain different handlers. The mapping could be
error-prone and tedious when a service handles many end-points.

This library solves these problems by using `JAX-RS <https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/>`__ annotations to build a path routing layer on top of Netty.

Build the HTTP Library
======================

::

  $ git clone https://github.com/cdapio/netty-http.git
  $ cd netty-http
  $ mvn clean package


Setting up an HTTP Service using the Library
============================================
Setting up an HTTP service is very simple using this library:

* Implement handler methods for different HTTP requests
* Annotate the routes for each handler
* Use a builder to setup the HTTP service

Example: A simple HTTP service that responds to the ``/v1/ping`` endpoint can be setup as:

.. code:: java

  // Set up Handlers for Ping
  public class PingHandler extends AbstractHttpHandler {
    @Path("/v1/ping")
    @GET
    public void testGet(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder){
      responder.sendString(HttpResponseStatus.OK, "OK");
    }
  }

  // Setup HTTP service and add Handlers

  // You can either add varargs of HttpHandler or as a list of HttpHanlders as below to the NettyService Builder

  List<HttpHandler> handlers = new ArrayList<>();
  handlers.add(new PingHandler());
  handlers.add(...otherHandler...)

  NettyHttpService service = NettyHttpService.builder("Name_of_app")
                             .setPort(7777)  // Optionally set the port. If unset, it will bind to an ephemeral port
                             .setHttpHandlers(handlers)
                             .build();

  // Start the HTTP service
  service.start();


Example: Sample HTTP service that manages an application lifecycle:

.. code:: java

  // Set up handlers
  // Setting up Path annotation on a class level will be pre-pended with
  @Path("/v1/apps")
  public class ApplicationHandler extends AbstractHandler {

    // The HTTP endpoint v1/apps/deploy will be handled by the deploy method given below
    @Path("deploy")
    @POST
    public void deploy(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder) {
      // ..
      // Deploy application and send status
      // ..
      responder.sendStatus(HttpResponseStatus.OK);
    }

    // For deploying larger-size applications we can use the BodyConsumer abstract-class,
    // we can handle the chunks as we receive it
    // and handle clean up when we are done in the finished method, this approach is memory efficient
    @Path("deploybig")
    @POST
    public BodyConsumer deployBig(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder) {
      return new BodyConsumer() {
        @Override
        public void chunk(ChannelBuffer request, HttpResponder responder) {
          // write the incoming data to a file
        }
        @Override
        public void finished(HttpResponder responder) {
          //deploy the app and send response
          responder.sendStatus(HttpResponseStatus.OK);
        }
        @Override
        public void handleError(Throwable cause) {
          // if there were any error during this process, this will be called.
          // do clean-up here.
        }
      }
    }

    // The HTTP endpoint v1/apps/{id}/start will be handled by the start method given below
    @Path("{id}/start")
    @POST
    public void start(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder, @PathParam("id") String id) {
      // The id that is passed in HTTP request will be mapped to a String via the PathParam annotation
      // ..
      // Start the application
      // ..
      responder.sendStatus(HttpResponseStatus.OK);
    }

    // The HTTP endpoint v1/apps/{id}/stop will be handled by the stop method given below
    @Path("{id}/stop")
    @POST
    public void stop(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder, @PathParam("id") String id) {
      // The id that is passed in HTTP request will be mapped to a String via the PathParam annotation
      // ..
      // Stop the application
      // ..
      responder.sendStatus(HttpResponseStatus.OK);
    }

    // The HTTP endpoint v1/apps/{id}/status will be handled by the status method given below
    @Path("{id}/status")
    @GET
    public void status(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder, @PathParam("id") String id) {
      // The id that is passed in HTTP request will be mapped to a String via the PathParam annotation
      // ..
      // Retrieve status the application
      // ..
      JsonObject status = new JsonObject();
      status.addProperty("status", "RUNNING");
      responder.sendJson(HttpResponseStatus.OK, status.toString());
    }
  }

  // Setup HTTP service and add Handlers

  // You can either add varargs of HttpHandler or as a list of HttpHandlers as below to the NettyService Builder

    List<HttpHandler> handlers = new ArrayList<>();
    handlers.add(new PingHandler());
    handlers.add(...otherHandler...)

  NettyHttpService service = NettyHttpService.builder("Name_of_app")
                            .setPort(7777)
                            .setHttpHandlers(handlers)
                            .build();

  // Start the HTTP service
  service.start();


Setting up an HTTPS Service
---------------------------
To run an HTTPS Service, add an additional function call to the builder::

  enableSSL(<File:keyStore>, <String:keyStorePassword>,  <String:certificatePassword>)

Code Sample:

.. code:: java

  // Setup HTTPS service and add Handlers
  NettyHttpService service = NettyHttpService.builder()
                             .setPort(7777)
                             .addHttpHandlers(new ApplicationHandler())
                             .enableSSL(SSLConfig.builder(new File("/path/to/keyStore.jks", "keyStorePassword")
                                        .setCertificatePassword("certificatePassword").build())
                             .build();

* Set ``String:certificatePassword`` as "null" when not applicable
* ``File:keyStore`` points to the key store that holds your SSL certificate
